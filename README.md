## Abstract
Web search is frequently used to satisfy information need about learning-related objectives. One of the most important outcomes of a web search session is knowledge gain. It can be influenced by user’s search behaviour, which includes user’s idleness, search time, task completion rate, user queries, visited SERPs, tendency to follow other people’s suggestions etc. However, it will be effective to find a suitable way to minimize search time, query number and SERPs number in a web search session without compromising the knowledge gain. In that case, following the suggestions and evaluation of previous users would be an efficient way. 

In this research work, our primary purpose is to obtain high knowledge gain with less search effort during a web search session. To achieve our goal, we have employed 500 distinct users from a crowdsourcing platform and orchestrated a real-world web search sessions on 10 different topics in order to determine the knowledge gain of users. We have divided our whole experiment into two phases. In the first phase, every user has performed a search on an assigned topic without following any suggestion and evaluation from previous users. In contrast in the second phase, every user is asked to provide suggestions (e.g. search queries, SERP URLs) and evaluation for the following users to minimize the search effort (e.g. search time, number of search queries, number of visited SERPs). After that, we have analyzed user interaction data of both phases to determine the difference between two phases based on knowledge gain, search time, number of search queries, number of visited SERPs, task completion rate, user’s idleness behaviour. In addition to that, we have also investigated the effect of topic on the terms mentioned above. Our results reveal that there is a significant effect of the former user’s suggestion on the following user’s knowledge gain. It is observed iv that in the second phase, the users have exhibited more knowledge gain because of following previous user’s suggestions. In this case, they needed to fire fewer search queries. Besides, they had to visit fewer search result pages(SERP) which helped to save their overall average search time.
